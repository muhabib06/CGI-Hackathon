To ensure enterprise readiness, the following gaps need to be addressed: 
- Implement input validation and error handling for all API endpoints.
- Add support for pagination and filtering for large datasets.
- Introduce rate limiting to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
- Develop a comprehensive security strategy, including encryption, secure password storage, and regular security audits.
- Establish a monitoring and logging system to track API performance and identify potential issues.
- Create a robust testing framework to ensure the API's reliability and stability.
- Develop a documentation strategy to keep API documentation up-to-date and easily accessible.
- Implement a versioning system to manage changes to the API and ensure backward compatibility.
- Establish a change management process to ensure that changes to the API are properly reviewed, tested, and deployed.
